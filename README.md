# Project Overview
This project is to implement 3-repetition code, Shor's code, quantum Hamming code. This project demonstrates quantum error correction by:

- Encoding a logical all-zero state using a stabilizer code

- Introducing random Pauli errors (X or Z) on each physical qubit

- Measuring error syndromes via stabilizer circuits and applying recovery operations

- Measuring logical qubits after error correction to verify the recovered state

- Analyzing and visualizing success probability as a function of the error rate

 
# What challenges have you detected in the process of building the error-correcting codes? 
It's hard to clearly divde the whole process into logical chunks and write functions in a way that could be generalized to different codewords.
